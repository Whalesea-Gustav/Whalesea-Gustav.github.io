## Breakpoint

debugger runs the program but stop before step into the `Breakpoint`. 

## Step over

execute the encapsulated codes, and jump into next line

(always used to run a entire code block, such as a fucntion / method, or something encapsulated)

## Step into

execute the next line of codes, if it is a function or `blackbox`, run into it and execute the details of the encapsulated



## Conditional Breakpoint

set some condition(s) in the `breakpoint` e.g `if flag = True`, stop running on that `Breakpoint`

Used in normal condition or Branchs (`While` / `For Loop`) 



## Resume

Run the following codes 

(**If `breakpoint` is in a loop, resume will restart the code runing,  process a loop,  and finally stop on the `Breakpoint` again)

Usually to test loops.
